Run csci111-v3-UCS.py.

It will ask what goal state you want to input. Valid inputs are as follows:

5 4 3 2 6 7 1 0 8 

0 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

If you wish to go for default goal state (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0), type 'default'.
The program will then generate you an initial state of your choosing.

WARNING: to maximize possible solutions, use 'default' as goal state to avoid any complications.
